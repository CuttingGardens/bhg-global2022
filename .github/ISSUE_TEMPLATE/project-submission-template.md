- [ ] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc.
- [ ] Goals for Brainhack Global 2020: describe what you want to achieve during this brainhack.
- [ ] Flesh out at least 2 ‚Äúgood first issues‚Äù: those are tasks that do not require any prior knowledge about your project, could be defined as issues in a GitHub repository, or in a shared document.
- [ ] Skills: list skills that would be particularly suitable for your project. We ask you to include at least one non-coding skill. Use the issue labels for this purpose.
- [ ] Chat channel: A link to a chat channel that will be used during the Brainhack Global 2020 event. This can be an existing channel or a new one. We recommend using the [Brainhack space on mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/).

For instance a [jitsi meet room](https://meet.jit.si/) **Please, do not make the video channel public in here**: post a message in your chat channel and pin it so that it remains private, you do not get undesired content, and contributors can still have access to it..

Optionally, you can also include information about:
