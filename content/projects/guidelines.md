   Brainhack Global 2021 Project Submission Guideline
</h1>

### Why a centralised project submission?

As the Brainhack Global team, we aim to :

- create a (de)centralized collaborative working platform,
- facilitate & increase across-site collaborations and interactions,
- give more visibility to the projects run under Brainhack Global,
- encourage sharing ideas, experiences and knowledge across parties,
- to remove barriers and allow contributions by researchers from all origins and
  disciplines.

Given that many events in this year Brainhack Global might be in part run
virtually, a common platform for project submission and listing will allow you
to submit your initial project call to gather interests from researchers from
all Brainhack Global event locations.

### Submitting a project

Please read our
**[How to Guideline for Leading and Attending to Brainhack Projects](https://github.com/brainhackorg/bhg-event-materials/blob/master/docs/leading_and_attending_to_brainhack_projects.md)**
to get more ideas about:

- how to design your project and what to expect from a Brainhack experience,
- how to lead a project,
- how to be an attendee of a project.

The ideal project should convey ideas with respect to the development of tools,
methodologies, guidelines and begets to brainstorming new ideas that would
facilitate the implementation of open science practices in neuroscience and
create more opportunities for collaborative work and information exchange within
the community.

   How will it work?

#### Fill in the project submission form

In order to submit a project to the Brainhack Global 2021 Project Gallery,
please follow these steps:

1. Register with an event listed in the
   **[Brainhack Global 2021 Events](https://brainhack.org/global2021/events/)**.
1. Create a **[GitHub](http://github.com/)** account.
1. Use
   [our project submission form](https://github.com/brainhackorg/global2021/issues/new?assignees=&labels=project&template=project-submission-template.md&title=)
   and fill in the necessary/required information as requested.

   1. Make sure that the information about your project is as clear and brief as
      possible.
   1. Share the necessary links that point reviewers/attendees to the right
      resources/repository and more detailed information about your project.

   1. Follow the instructions in the
      **[How to Guideline for Leading and Attending to Brainhack Projects](https://github.com/brainhackorg/bhg-event-materials/blob/master/docs/leading_and_attending_to_brainhack_projects.md)**
      to increase the diversity and inclusivity in your project work and define
      the tasks, roles and the skills that you are expecting from your attendees
      accordingly. Make sure that you have room for newcomers to give them a
      chance to learn from more senior colleagues and share their own
      experiences.

   1. Choose/create the label pointing to the event location that you are
      registered with.

   1. Follow the instructions given in the project form to choose the labels for
      your project. These labels can help match your project with the attendees'
      interests.

   1. After you are done filling in the necessary/required information, open the
      issue to submit your project to be reviewed.

   1. Remember that you can make always amend your project submission as
      necessary during the reviewing process.

### What happens next?

Once you have submitted your project, a reviewer from the event that you have
registered with will follow up with you and will review the information in your
issue. They may request some changes if deemed necessary. If all
necessary/required information is in place, the project will be marked as
`status:web_ready` and will be listed on the
**[Brainhack Global 2021 Projects](https://brainhack.org/global2021/projects/)**
page after a short delay. A subpage dedicated to your own project will be
automatically created. In the meantime, you can still continue to make changes
to your project submission.

The Brainhack Global team will try to match event attendees to projects across
the globe based the expertise/skill sets that attendees want to acquire and the
projects are looking for. Once the attendee registrations are completed, the
matching algorithm will be run by the local organizers themselves based on the
information provided by the attendees in the participant registration form. The
attendees will be automatically sent an email that is listing the best fitting
projects with their expertise and interests. However, the preference of the
project the attendees will join will be based on the attendees own decision.
They could either go with the suggested options or they could choose among the
other projects listed in the
**[Brainhack Global 2021 Projects](https://brainhack.org/global2021/projects/)**
page. Based on the communication channels listed in the project issues, the
attendees will contact the project leaders.

Please be aware that, at the very early stage of the interactions, attendees
might just want to contact you for more information to make sure that the
project is a good fit to the aims they want to achieve from a Brainhack.
Therefore, please make sure that you welcome all attentions and explain your
project with care and guide them as necessary.
