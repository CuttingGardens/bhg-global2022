### Why a Centralised Project Submission?

As the Brainhack Global team, we aim to create a (de)centralized collaborative working platform that would facilitate & increase across-site collaborations and interactions while also giving visibility to the projects run under Brainhack Global as much as possible. Creating such a (de)centralized platform and workflow, we aim to encourage sharing ideas, experiences and knowledge across parties, removing the barriers and allowing contributions by researchers from all around the globe and a myriad of disciplines.

Given that this year Brainhack Global will be run virtually, we would like to create a (de)centralized project submission and listing platform that would allow you to submit your initial project call to gather interests from researchers from every single Brainhack Global event location. 

The ideal project should convey ideas with respect to the development of tools, methodologies, guidelines and begets to brainstorming new ideas that would facilitate the implementation of open science practices in neuroscience and create more opportunities for collaborative work and information exchange within the community.

If you would like to get more ideas about:

- how to design your project and what to expect from a Brainhack experience,
- how to lead a project,
- how to be an attendee of a project

Please read our **[How to Guideline for Leading and Attending to Brainhack Projects](https://github.com/brainhackorg/bhg-event-materials/blob/master/docs/leading_and_attending_to_brainhack_projects.md)**!

<h2 style="font-family:'Pacifico';color:#fe97a0">How will it work?</h2>

### Where to start?


In order to submit a project to the Brainhack Global 2020 Project Gallery, please follow these steps:

1. Register with an event listed in the **[Brainhack Global 2020 Events](https://brainhack.org/global2020/events/)**.
1. Create a **[GitHub](http://github.com/)** account.
1. Go to the **[Brainhack 2020 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/brainhackorg/global2020/issues)**.
1. Click on the **New Issue** button on the up right. 
1. Create a new issue by clicking on the **Get Started** button beside **Project submission template**.
1. Fill in the necessary/required information as requested. 
1. Please make sure that the information about your project is as clear and brief as possible sharing the necessary links that point reviewers/attendees to the right resources/repository and more detailed information about your project.
1. Please make sure to follow the instructions in the **[How to Guideline for Leading and Attending to Brainhack Projects](https://github.com/brainhackorg/bhg-event-materials/blob/master/docs/leading_and_attending_to_brainhack_projects.md)** to increase the diversity and inclusivity in your project work and define the tasks, roles and the skills that you are expecting from your attendees accordingly. Make sure that you have room for newcomers to give them a chance to learn from more seniored colleagues and share their own experiences.
1. Choose/create the label that is pointing to the event location that you are registered with.
1. Choose the labels from the labels menu that are associated with your project. This will help us to make correct assignments of attendees to your project and will help us with curating the right attention to your project.
1. After you are done filling in the necessary/required information, open the issue to submit your project to be reviewed. 
1. Do not forget that you can make amendments in your issue template as necessary/required to do so along with and after the reviewing process.


### What happens next? 

Once you have submitted your project, a reviewer from the event that you have registered with will follow up with you and will review the information in your issue. They may request some changes if deemed necessary. If all necessary/required information is in place, the project will be marked as *ready to be published* and will be listed on the **[Brainhack Global 2020 Projects](https://brainhack.org/global2020/projects/)** page after a short delay. A subpage dedicated to your own project will be automatically created. In the meantime, you can still continue to make changes in/to your issue. 

This year, Brainhack Global also offers a new feature to assign event attendees to projects across the globe based on the matching between expertise/skill sets that attendees want to acquire and the skills projects are looking for. The attendees will be automatically sent an email listing 3 projects with the best fit to their expertise and expectations to be involved in a project. However, the preference of the project they will attend will be left to the attendees themselves. They could either go with the suggested options or they could choose among the other projects listed in the **[Brainhack Global 2020 Projects](https://brainhack.org/global2020/projects/)** page. Based on the communication channels the project leaders listed in their issues, the attendees will contact the project leaders as necessary. 

Please be aware that, at the very early stage of the interactions, attendees might just want to contact you for more information to make sure that the project is a good fit to the aims they want to achieve from the Brainhack. Therefore, please make sure that you welcome all attentions and explain your project with care.
