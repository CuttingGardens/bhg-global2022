[Brainhack 2020 Beijing & Nanning](https://brainhack.live/) will focus its events on the translational applications of the brain growth charts.
 We are thus inviting all the researchers to participate this event and practice the open science. As a basic resource, 
 the normative data of the brain development across school age will be opened to all the participants who submit a relevant project.
  This is a one-week hack event including sessions for education course, project team building and summarizing report.
