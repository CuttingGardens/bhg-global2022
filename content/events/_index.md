<!-- We could display a gallery of all events with a map on top from Home so it is easily searchable per location. + add some filtering options.

Then right under the gallery we could display some general streaming sessions easily accessible to people. 

Eventually, we could have something similar for specific project streaming and highlighting the ones with people in? -->
