[Brainhack Princeton](https://brainhack-princeton.github.io/2020/) will (virtually) bring together researchers to collaborate on projects 
aimed at improving open and reproducible neuroscience. Over the course of three days, participants will pitch projects and work together on 
these projects (e.g. contributing content to the Princeton Handbook for [Reproducible Neuroscience](https://brainhack-princeton.github.io/handbook/index.html)). 
There will also be tutorials to introduce tools and resources that can be used to facilitate best open science practices in your own work.
