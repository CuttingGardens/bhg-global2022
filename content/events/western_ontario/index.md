Our first virtual [BrainHack Global - Ontario](https://brainhackto.github.io/global-ON-2020/) co-hosted by BrainHack Western and BrainHack Toronto. 
Join us on December 2nd to 4th over Chrowdcast for a completely free event focused on neuroscience and the promotion of open-source resources in an 
accessible way across disciplines and experience levels including hacking, education, panels, and networking. Even though we will be physically distant, 
there will be the possibility to come together and socialize on the Brainhack Ontario GatherTown platform. We will be using the platform to host exciting
 social activities throughout the event. Stay tuned for the social activities program!
