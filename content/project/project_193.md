It doesn\u2019t support physiological files recorded with the MRI (yet).\r\nNext to `phys2bids`, we\u2019re starting the development of [`phys2denoise`](https://github.com/physiopy/phys2denoise), a library dedicated to prepare physiological signal for fMRI denoising.\r\n\r\n<!--Describe the main idea and context of your project in a few sentences.-->\r\n\r\n**Link to project**: https://github.com/physiopy/phys2bids\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**: @smoia\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\nWe have different proposals for Brainhack participants, that can be seen [here](https://github.com/physiopy/phys2bids/milestone/5).\r\nBetween the contributors, we have very different background, but one that is lacking is knowledge in pattern recognition or ML.
