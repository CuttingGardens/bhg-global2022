In this project, we attempt to create a [git-annex special remote](https://git-annex.branchable.com/special_remotes/) implementation to leverage OSF filestorage and make the data storing that OSF provides even more useful. The git-annex OFS special remote would allow to transform OSF storage into git-annex repositories. Files in OSF storage could thus be consumed or exported fast and easily via git-annex or [datalad](https://github.com/datalad/datalad), and published to repository-hosting services (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, ...) as lightweight repositories that constitute an alternative access to the data stored on the OSF - that is: you can ``git clone`` a repository from for example GitHub and ``get`` the data from the OSF from the command line or in your scripts.\r\n\r\n**Link to project**: https://github.com/adswa/git-annex-remote-osf\r\nThere is no code yet - we will assemble a group of interested Brainhackers and start from scratch\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**: adina\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n- Familiarize ourselves with git-annex's concept of special remotes\r\n- Explore the [OSF API ](https://developer.osf.io/#tag/Introduction) and [OSF's waterbutler](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/waterbutler) to interact with OSF's various supported file storage services\r\n- Get started with a Python-based special-remote implementation\r\n- Set up appropriate documentation\r\n- Short term goal: export and import data from public OSF projects from and into git-annex repositories\r\n- Nice-to-have's/Long(er) term development goals: Extend functionality to private repositories (requires token-based authentication)\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n- Set up the [allcontributors-bot](https://allcontributors.org/) in the project repository to acknowledge contributions\r\n- Create a public and a private project on the Open Science Framework for us to play with. The more comprehensive this task is carried out, the better. Here's a sketch: Add (any) data (honestly, any - cat content, your favorite recipe, a funny video, ...) to different storage providers (OSFStorage, GDrive, Dropbox, ...) to a public and a private repository on the OSF. Make sure that some data exists in a single version, but also take data and update it with a modified version, using the [OSF's version control features](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019738694-file-revisions-and-version-control).\r\n\r\nYou can find more **good first issues** in the project repository: https://github.com/adswa/git-annex-remote-osf/issues :hugs:\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n- **Technical writing**: Good user documentation is essential. Depending on what you are interested to do this could take the form of a README, a [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/) or [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)-based technical documentation, tutorials, a usecase in the [DataLad handbook](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/), or anything else that you can think of.\r\n- **Experience with the Open Science Framework**: If you are a user of the Open Science Framework, let us know how you use it, walk us through a public project of yours, provide us with projects to use for testing, your ideas and needs,  ... If you have used the OSF then you will be a great help!\r\n- **Python programming**: We aim for a special remote implementation in Python. There are [good templates](https://github.com/Lykos153/AnnexRemote) and [many](https://github.com/CONP-PCNO/git-annex-remote-globus) [examples](https://github.com/Lykos153/git-annex-remote-googledrive) that we will use and learn from along the way.\r\n- **Interest in git-annex or experience with it**: We are looking for git-annex experts and novices alike - and everything in between. If you saw \"git-annex\" and thought \"uuhhhh, interesting :thinking:\" then come get on board!\r\n- **Knowledge about HTTP requests/authentication**\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/git-annex-osf\r\n\r\n**Video channel**\r\nPlease have a look at the [Mattermost channel](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/git-annex-osf) (pinned posts) for the URL of the video channel, or alternatively, please contact to @adswa.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- **Video channel**:\r\nhttps://meet.jit.si/git-annex-osf -->\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username).
