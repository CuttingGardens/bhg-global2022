Codes is mostly in matlab and we should move in Python, moreover the converter from Trackvis to STL for 3Dprinting or Augmented Reality is not good. I am openminded to other ideas for tractography.\r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\nhttps://github.com/alecrimi/tracktools\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**:\r\nIn the latest years I have developed/collected some tools for brain tractography, from inclusion in html, to 3Dprinter conversion to other manipulations. Codes is mostly in matlab and we should move in Python, moreover the converter from Trackvis to STL for 3Dprinting or Augmented Reality is not good. I am openminded to other ideas for tractography..\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\nConvert tracts into surface for 3D printing or augmented reality.\r\nTake a look at the whole list of [issues](https://github.com/alecrimi/tracktools/issues).\r\n\r\n**Participant capacity**: \r\nUnlimited. We are open-minded to all contributors.\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\nPython, basic knowledge of tractography, ideally Dipy.\r\n\r\n**Twitter-size summary of your project pitch**:\r\nimage: https://github.com/alecrimi/tracktools/blob/master/screenshot.png\r\nCollection of tractography tools for various porpuses, from online visualization (html), #3Dprinting, #AugmentedReality and data manipulation\r\nhttps://github.com/alecrimi/tracktools/   \r\nProject lead @alecrimi\r\n#OHBMHackathon #Brainhack #OHBM2020\r\n \r\n**Chat channel**:\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-tracktools\r\nProject leader ID on mattermost: dr.alecrimi\r\n\r\n<!-- **Video channel**: -->\r\nhttps://meet.jit.si/NAMEOFTHEPROJECT or check on mattermost chat channel\r\n\r\n**Contributions**:\r\nAll contributors (participants and teams) will be listed in our public repository. Future participation after the hackathon is encouraged but not expected.\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\n-   [x] [Repository](https://github.com/alecrimi/tracktools) \r\n-   [x] Goals for the OHBM Brainhack\r\n-   [x] Flesh out at least 2 \"good first issues\": \r\n-   [x] Skills\r\n-   [x] Chat channel:\r\n-   [x] Video channel:\r\n\r\nOptionally, you can also include information about:\r\n-   [x] Number of participants, cf. [Unlimited]\r\n-   [x] Twitter-size summary of your project pitch, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#twitter-size-summary-of-your-project-pitch)\r\n-   [x] Provide an image of your project for the OHBM brainhack website\r\n\r\nWe would like to think about how you will credit and onboard new members to your project. We recommend reading references from [this section](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#credit-and-onboarding).
