If the user chooses to add a new term, the tool will create and export a new BIDS specification term as a JSON-LD file and push it to our [terms](https://github.com/NIDM-Terms/terms/tree/master/terms/BIDS_Terms) repository where discussion surrounding the new term can be captured using git/github. Such an effort will provide the BIDS working group with a user-friendly tool to build tables for the BIDS documentation while ensuring they have not re-purposed an existing BIDS specification term giving it conflicting definitions.  For additional information on the background for this project see BIDS specification [issue 423](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/issues/423).\r\n\r\n<!--Describe the main idea and context of your project in a few sentences.-->\r\n\r\n**Link to project**: https://github.com/nqueder/bids_terms_to_pdf_table\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**: @nazek.queder\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n\r\n* Create a Python-based tool allowing users to specify subsets of [BIDS specification terms](https://github.com/NIDM-Terms/terms/tree/master/terms/BIDS_Terms) and properties of those terms to include in a PDF-formatted table for inclusion into specifications.\r\n* Create JSON-LD files for newly added BIDS specification terms.\r\n* Creating a document with clear instructions for the user on how to use our tool.\r\n* Create an automated way to push newly created JSON-LD files to the [Interlex](https://scicrunch.org/nidm-terms) information resource.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n* Create a [Scicrunch](https://scicrunch.org/nidm-terms) account and generate a new Interlex API key, for instructions on how to generate an Interlex API key please visit our [github repository](https://github.com/nqueder/bids_terms_to_pdf_table).\r\n* Review the BIDS specification documents and our [NIDM-Terms](https://github.com/NIDM-Terms/terms) repository and get familiar with our current group of [BIDS terms](https://github.com/NIDM-Terms/terms/tree/master/terms/BIDS_Terms).\r\n\r\n**Skills**: \r\n\r\n* Python \r\n* Data query\r\n* Git - any level\r\n* BIDS - Brain Imaging Data Structure\r\n* Knowledge about JSON and JSON-LD is recommended but not required\r\n* Someone who knows how to develop good, tidy and clear documentation for developing clear and well structured user\u2019s instructions\r\n* Someone with good research and document analysis skills\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:  https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbm_bids-terms-to-pdf\r\n<!-- If you are creating a channel on the [brainhack mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) try to create a\r\n**public** channel with one of the following template names:\r\n\r\n- hbmhack-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n- hbm-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n\r\nThese would be the corresponding URLs that you can paste here.\r\n\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbm-NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n**Video Channel:** \r\nPlease have a look at the [Mattermost channel](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbm_bids-terms-to-pdf) (pinned posts) for the URL of the video channel, or alternatively, please contact to @nazek.queder on Mattermost.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n**Video channel**: A link to our Zoom meeting room will be provided as a pinned message in the [chat channel](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbm_bids-terms-to-pdf)\r\n\r\nWe are trying to be super careful about \"zoom bombing\" possibility.\r\nSo we want to avoid having links to video chats in \"public space\".\r\nWe suggest that you create a Jitsi or Zoom room and mention it in your text channel as \"pinned\" message or in the channel header.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Image for the OHBM brainhack website** \r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username).
