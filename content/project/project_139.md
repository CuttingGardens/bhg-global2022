There are some starting points on single pre-processing steps (e.g. [Jaswal et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920302846); [Luck & Gaspelin, 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/psyp.12639), [Robbins et al., 2020](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9047940/)), but no attempt to systematically track the impact of all steps (like the NARPS project did).\r\n\r\nOne problem might be that **there is not even yet a good common framework to compare different analysis pipelines with each other**. There are the [COBIDAS-MEEG guidelines](https://cobidasmeeg.wordpress.com/) (still a [pre-print](https://osf.io/a8dhx/)), which are a very good starting point, but which were designed as a detailed checklist for _reporting_ single isolated analyses rather than a framework for identifying commonalities between different analyses. Furthermore, the fact that it is very detailed and exhaustive does not make it very user-friendly (yet).\r\n\r\nThe aim of this hackathon is to create such a framework in a more **bottom-up way, focusing on the essential steps** needed to compare different pipelines. We will start by looking at existing pre-registrations, tracking what people do and what they struggle with, to then come up with a framework which we map onto software options, and finally maybe start with an adaptive app that facilitates pre-registration of EEG/MEG analyses.\r\n\r\nSuch an enterprise might be very fruitful for subsequent empirical exploration of how the parameters involved in EEG/MEG analyses matter for the results, e.g. in the [EEGManyLabs project](https://twitter.com/hashtag/eegmanylabs?lang=en) or the [ManyPipelines project](https://twitter.com/TomRhysMarshall/status/1265606022716108805?s=20).\r\nAlso, it might facilitate the creation of a **user-friendly** EEG/MEG pre-registration templates (currently in the making, see e.g. [this one started at the SIPS meeting 2019](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RmlHcWJcWMErZzjJgz9Q0rqsy-E9Vs9DYeKdvX9cawU/edit), which will also be worked on during Thursday June 18 in the afternoon at a [virtual hackathon at the MPI-CBS](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/1543216/preregistration-hackathon), and [this spin-off started at the Donders Institute in November 2019](https://docs.google.com/document/d/160DcKWpeYmoc-aEYZaoKN43534wvTyMJEFBQdahGBjU/edit)).\r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\n- [GoogleDocs folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YWyNR3Zh9O-eAbhTINPmybhhBom_vAD3?usp=sharing) (click and request access, I will add you)<br/> for real-time collaboration on text documents (word files, spreadsheets)\r\n- [Github repository](https://github.com/johalgermissen/mapMEEG)<br/>for working on more permanent documents that need version control, as well as code (if we start building an app in the end)\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**:\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**:\r\n* Find and code available pre-registrations/ registered reports using EEG/MEG data\r\n* Defining a framework of essential steps useful to compare different analyses\r\n* Map different software options onto these steps\r\n* (Start) designing an (\"automated\"/ \"adaptive\") EEG/MEG pre-registration template (app people can fill in, with help links etc.)\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n* Find repositories/ webpages that track neuroimaging projects/ papers with pre-registrations\r\n* Fill in those projects/ papers in a huge list ([example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_R3UBKvT4vEDOAPXxR8W98QGvZMhpuyxlvYzIGekf0w/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=107034845673249190997))\r\n* Rate submitted projects/ papers on several items (e.g. software used, pre-registered processing and analysis steps, deviations from the pre-registration reported in the paper)\r\n\r\nOn Thursday (June 18) afternoon, there will be a parallel hackathon organized by @mariellapaul and @aschetti via the Max-Planck-Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (Leipzig, Germany) that will aim to make progress on [this pre-registration template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RmlHcWJcWMErZzjJgz9Q0rqsy-E9Vs9DYeKdvX9cawU/edit).
