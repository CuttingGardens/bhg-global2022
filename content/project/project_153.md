We already have a working demo of this app, and you can try it [here](https://www.repronim.org/reproschema-ui/#/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FRemi-Gau%2FeCobidas%2Fhack_artemis_202110%2Fschemas%2Fartemis%2Fprotocols%2Fartemis_schema.jsonld).\r\n\r\nJoin us in the Hack to make the tools we need!\r\n\r\n### Link to project repository/sources\r\n\r\nLink to project repository/sources \r\nCurrent and previous versions of static docs can be found on the ARTEM-IS OSF: https://osf.io/nrh2k/\r\nEditable doc links will be shared directly on Mattermost and in the ARTEM-IS Clubroom in Gathertown.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Goals for Brainhack Global\r\n\r\nFor this hackathon, we will be working on two fronts.\r\n\r\nFirst goal is to fix some of the existing bugs in the web-app template: [list of issues](https://github.com/Remi-Gau/artemis_checklist/issues).\r\n\r\nWe will also be working on creating the body of terms for the future EEG terminology lexicon of terms present in ARTEM-IS Templates (currently ARTEM-IS Template for ERP). This lexicon will eventually accompany templates as part of help and documentation. During this hackathon, we will work on: \r\n\r\n1. identifying terms that are present in the current ARTEM-IS template, and not on the list of terms that will be included in the ARTEM-IS lexicon; \r\n2. identifying terms that exist in the following lexicons of terminology: NIDM communities (i.e. NIDM Terms, NIDM Concepts, BIDS Specification, CONP DATS, Neurobridge), InterLex and COBIDAS; \r\n3. adding proposals for definitions for terms that are not defined.\r\n\r\n### Good first issues\r\n\r\n1. web-app: Using our documentation you can run the app on your computer and make live changes to the questions displayed by the app.\r\n2. lexicon: identifying terms that are present in the current ARTEM-IS template, and not on the list of terms that will be included in the ARTEM-IS lexicon\r\n\r\n\r\n### Communication channels\r\n\r\nMattermost: https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/artem-is \r\nARTEM-IS Gathertown Clubroom: https://gather.town/app/Bw3fcD2KiO11izhe/artemisclubroom  (Password on Mattermost)\r\n\r\n**daily check in in the Clubroom: 8 AM CET (3 PM SGT, 6 PM AEDT)**\r\n\r\n### Skills\r\n\r\nFor the goal of fixing bugs, basic spreadsheet experience, as well as programming skills (in particular javascript and Vue.js) are both welcome! More experienced coders can take part in debugging, but newbies to programming can also be very helpful with troubleshooting. Experience conducting EEG or describing EEG methods would be a bonus, but not necessary to participate.\r\n\r\nTo work on the lexicon, knowledge about EEG methodology and terminology will be essential, but no programming skills at all are expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Onboarding documentation\r\n\r\nWill be made available via Mattermost and permanently stored on the OSF project.\r\n\r\n### What will participants learn?\r\n\r\nParticipants will be part of an open science collaborative project. They will become familiar with electrophysiology and different resources and initiatives to standardize and report neuroimaging data and analysis methodology. Particularly, they will get insights into the metascience of EEG, and improve their understanding of EEG methodology, and best practice in documenting and reporting it.\r\n\r\nParticipants who will take part in the app improvement, either by helping programmers troubleshoot issues or by working on these issues themselves, will get an opportunity to practice programming skills and exchange knowledge with others. Participants will also have an opportunity to work on an example of Reproschema standardized form generation schema (A standardized form generation and data collection schema).\r\n\r\nParticipants who work on the EEG terminology lexicon will get an opportunity to work on the development of a lexicon of EEG terms, as well as to get insights into existing lexicons of neuroscience terminology and the process of building a new lexicon and integrating it into the community of other lexicons.\r\n\r\n### Data to use\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Number of collaborators\r\n\r\nmore\r\n\r\n### Credit to collaborators\r\n\r\nContributors in this hackathon will be acknowledged on a contributors page in the ARTEM-IS OSF Project (https://osf.io/ut9pc/ and https://osf.io/nrh2k/contributors).\r\n\r\n### Image\r\n\r\n<img width=\"347\" alt=\"artemis logo\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34712730/143604143-2c021a10-72d9-42b4-8803-1d7e87c52afa.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Type\r\n\r\ncoding_methods, documentation, other\r\n\r\n### Development status\r\n\r\n1_basic structure\r\n\r\n### Topic\r\n\r\nEEG_EventRelatedResponseModelling, reproducible_scientific_methods\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n\r\nother\r\n\r\n### Programming language\r\n\r\ndocumentation, other, not_applicable\r\n\r\n### Modalities\r\n\r\nEEG\r\n\r\n### Git skills\r\n\r\n0_no_git_skills, 1_commit_push, 2_branches_PRs, 3_continuous_integration\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nProgramming language: JavaScript\r\n\r\n### Things to do after the project is submitted and ready to review.\r\n\r\n- [X] Add a comment below the main post of your issue saying: `Hi @brainhackorg/project-monitors my project is ready!`\r\n- [X] Twitter-sized summary of your project pitch.",
