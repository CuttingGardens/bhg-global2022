  "project_description": "\r\n*Overview:* Children with ADHD, PTSD or generalized anxiety benefit from neurofeedback from an EEG while performing a task (e.g. focusing, calming) to develop cognitive skills that can assist them to cope and perform better throughout life.  Some problems with this training a) the tools need to be easy to access and setup (e.g. wearable); b) the feedback should be engaging and ideally involving multiple senses (e.g. visual, auditory, 3D, aromas); and c) the feedback should be based on both brain waves (EEG) and other indicators (e.g. body motion, heart rate, breathing rate) to provide richer self-understanding. \r\n*Problem:* Develop an app for use with a wearable neurofeedback system (e.g. Muse, Emotiv, OpenBCI) that provides richer environmental feedback and/or sensing to better serve the ADHD, PTSD or generalized anxiety pediatric populations.\r\n*Further information:*Neurofeedback uses operant learning/conditioning to train the brain to optimize its function; in essence it\u2019s a form of \u201crebalancing\u201d of brain function depending on the protocols used. A simple neurofeedback system utilizes SMR rhythm and alpha frequencies to focus and calm the mind. When the brain learns to mimic the frequencies and maintain those patterns it rewarded. Reward schedules are changed to increase the brains ability to hold the \u201cnew\u201d normal/equilibrium, which over time teaches the brain to maintain a \u201cnew\u201d or previous \u201cnormal\u201d (equilibrium). Many people use it for all sorts of conditions as well as to increase performance. People who are out of touch with their feelings or body sensations (e.g. heart rate) would benefit from a non-invasive, self-directed way to become aware of and gain control of these functions. This could help them to realize the benefit of consistently and achieving their set goals. There is also a need to provide visual data to both the client and the clinician tracking changes and measuring success or problem areas.\r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-multimod-nf\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**:\r\nhbmhack-multimod-nf\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\nResearch potential avenues to address the problem with existing technologies and design a prototype that would address shortcomings.
