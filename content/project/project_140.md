  "project_description": "\r\nWhereas we can build time-varying functional connectivity (TVFC) graphs easily and efficiently using instantaneous wavelet coherence. And whereas we can compare TVFC graphs using a host of graph-graph metrics---from simple edge-wise overlap, to more robust methods from topological data analysis. The capacity to understand how TVFC states compare among volunteers is limited by the transductive nature of state-of-the-art manifold embedding algorithms such as tSNE and UMAP. Transductive methods tend to overweight the temporal adjacencies of graph-graph distances measured within single volunteers, and thereby ignore the large-scale graph-graph similarities measured across volunteers. To address this issue, this project aims to build vector embeddings of several matrices of TVFC graph-graph distances. One class of inductive and vectorized embedding that may work well is the Siamese neural network. We should try to look at some other techniques too.\r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\nhttps://github.com/users/JacobCWBillings/projects/1\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**:\r\nchannels/vectorize_dynamics\r\n@jacob.billings\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\nVectorize distances between time-varying functional connectivity graphs.
