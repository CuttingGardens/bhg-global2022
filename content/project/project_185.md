The general idea is that in forums such as Reddit, links to scientific articles are posted and a public discussion often follows; in these discussions there are often questions or misconceptions that may be best clarified by experts. Brainfeed seeks to track these discussions and notify experts when there are discussions/questions that are relevant to them.\r\n\r\nInitial development of this project is aimed at tracking neuroimaging-related discussions on Reddit, but this tool could in principle be extended to any scientific field and could also track other forums such as Twitter. Details on getting started, resources, etc... are available in the README.md doc on the project Github page (https://github.com/yohanyee/brainfeed)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Link to project repository/sources\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/yohanyee/brainfeed\r\n\r\n### Goals for Brainhack Global\r\n\r\nA list of specific goals for this Brainhack, along with future goals, can be found in the Github README.md file. \r\n\r\nThe general goal for Brainhack Toronto is to lay down the general framework and structure of the project, along with some basic code aimed at the specific goals listed in the README.md file; further development can occur after the event and will be coordinated through a Brainhack mattermost channel (https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/brainfeed).\r\n\r\n### Good first issues\r\n\r\n1. issue one: how to best classify posts as being relevant (neuroimaging related) or not?\r\n\r\n2. issue two: how do we structure the post/comment database?\r\n\r\n3. Issue three: what is the most engaging way to display discussions to experts?\r\n\r\n### Communication channels\r\n\r\nFor Brainhack Toronto 2021: https://discord.gg/6pq9RgtM\r\n\r\nAfter the event, we will transition to the Brainhack Mattermost channel for further development: https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/brainfeed \r\n\r\n### Skills\r\n\r\n- Python (to scrape public discussions on scientific articles): any skill level \r\n- NLP / text classification (to classify if discussions/questions are relevant): any skill level\r\n- UX/UI (to display relevant discussions in a meaningful manner): any skill level\r\n\r\n### Onboarding documentation\r\n\r\nSee README.md\r\n\r\n### What will participants learn?\r\n\r\nSome skills that may be learned:\r\n- web scraping via Python APIs\r\n- text mining and classification\r\n- interfacing with databases (Firestore database)\r\n\r\n### Data to use\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Number of collaborators\r\n\r\nmore\r\n\r\n### Credit to collaborators\r\n\r\nContributors will be listed in a file on Github (probably the README.md using the [all-contributors github bot](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) )\r\n\r\n### Image\r\n\r\nLeave this text if you don't have an image yet.\r\n\r\n### Type\r\n\r\ndata_management, other\r\n\r\n### Development status\r\n\r\n1_basic structure\r\n\r\n### Topic\r\n\r\nother\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n\r\nother\r\n\r\n### Programming language\r\n\r\nPython, html_css, javascript\r\n\r\n### Modalities\r\n\r\nnot_applicable\r\n\r\n### Git skills\r\n\r\n0_no_git_skills, 1_commit_push\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nTopic: scientific communication\r\n\r\n### Things to do after the project is submitted and ready to review.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add a comment below the main post of your issue saying: `Hi @brainhackorg/project-monitors my project is ready!`\r\n- [ ] Twitter-sized summary of your project pitch.",
