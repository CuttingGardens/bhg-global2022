  "project_description": "\r\nPyNets is a tool for sampling and analyzing varieties of individual structural and functional connectomes. PyNets enables the user to specify any of a variety of methodological choices  impacting node and/or edge definition, and then sample the prescribed connectome estimates in a massively parallel framework that is conducive to predictive optimization (i.e. grid-search). PyNets is a post-processing workflow, which means that it can be run on virtually any preprocessed fMRI or dMRI data. It relies on Dipy, Nilearn, Networkx, and the Nipype workflow engine under-the-hood. It can now also be deployed as a BIDS application, where it takes BIDS derivatives and makes BIDS derivatives. \r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\n<https://github.com/dPys/PyNets>\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**:\r\n@dPys\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n- This project is being included as a BrainHack project in preparation for its 1.0.0 official release before the end of June! I will be working on pushing integration testing and documentation/tutorials primarily throughout the week, but am very open working on any number of sub-project ideas as well (see below for examples).\r\n\r\n- Recruit new developers and co-authors, ensure all possible workflow combinations are bug-proof, and promote the technology more widely to researchers and students in the network neuroscience community.\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n- Create a general-purpose function for robustly normalizing any atlas to a given brain template (without requiring the install of an additional dependency)\r\n- Jupyter notebooks with examples running the bids API with your own personal BIDS datasets. \r\n- Browser-based visualization fine-tuning (background with html/css/javascript preferred).\r\n- Unit tests!\r\n- Complete citation.py bibTex entries from docstring and configure duecredit decorators.\r\n\r\n**Good advanced issues**:\r\n- Multiplex graph theory / multigraph community detection.\r\n- Connectome topic modeling (I have a WIP that uses NiMare/Neurosynth and NLP that you can expand upon).\r\n- Converting FSL-based linear and non-linear registration wrappers to pure dipy (I have all the functions that you'd need).\r\n- Port any relevant utilities / general-purpose functions to Nilearn and Dipy wherever appropriate.\r\n- Re-wrap with Pydra.\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\nAll skill levels, backgrounds, and perspectives welcome.\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:\r\n- hbmhack-pynets\r\n<https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-pynets>\r\n\r\n**Video channel**:\r\nMeetings will be conducted through jitsi.
