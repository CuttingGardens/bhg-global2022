It also provides interoperability with other data acquisition/storage/analysis/sharing platforms and utilities. One such utility developed by the AEDAPT team is SOVABIDS -- a graphical converter from raw EEG data to the BIDS standard.\r\nAEDAPT and SOVABIDS are funded by the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC), Swinburne University, University of Queensland and Sydney University. SOVABIDS was also funded by Google Summer of Code.\r\n\r\n**What makes your project special and exciting?**\r\nAnalysis pipelines for EEG/MEG/MRI data typically rely on specific versions of packages and software, and are dependent on their native operating system. These dependencies mean that a working analysis pipeline may fail or produce different results on a new computer, or even on the same computer after a software update. The frequent release of versions also means that researchers need to spend a lot of time on installing and upgrading software.\r\nAEDAPT provides a platform in which anyone, anywhere, using any computer can reproduce the original research findings given the original data and analysis code. Moreover, SOVABIDS allows the conversion of the original data to BIDS, thus making it easier for others to re-analyse the data using other tools.\r\n\r\nAEDAPT and SOVABIDS are intended to serve researchers and developers in Australia and worldwide, and would be maintained by the community as open-source projects. It is a great opportunity to familiarise yourself with the neuroscience open-source community, as we are working closely with prominent developers and scientists all around the world.\r\n\r\n**How to get started?**\r\nHead over to the resource links below and try Neurodesk (the technological platform on which AEDAPT runs) and SOVABIDS. Both are already tested and usable.\r\n\r\n**Where to find key resources?**\r\n\r\n- https://neurodesk.github.io/docs/\r\n- https://sovabids.readthedocs.io/\r\n- https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2021/projects/6615935850381312/\r\n\r\n### Link to project repository/sources\r\n\r\nhttps://neurodesk.github.io/\r\nhttps://sovabids.readthedocs.io/ \r\n\r\n### Goals for Brainhack Global\r\n\r\n- Adding EEG/MEG data analysis tools as preinstalled tools in AEDAPT (each tool is packed within a container)\r\n- Check here for the list of current packages: https://github.com/orgs/NeuroDesk/packages?repo_name=neurocontainers\r\n- Adding MATLAB IDE support to Neurodesk (the technology platform of AEDAPT)\r\n- Right now we only support compiled MATLAB code, but we want our users to be able to use the MATLAB IDE using a personal or site MATLAB license.\r\n- Improving the SOVABIDS raw EEG data to BIDS standard graphical converter\r\n- Add support for the specific EEG format you are working on, so it can be easily converted to the BIDS standard (right now SOVABIDS only supports Neuroscan\u2019s proprietary binary format: .cnt), or work on the other improvements we consider in SOVABIDS (https://gist.github.com/yjmantilla/7004f6ba1bf517c1321b458165aee62b#work-left-to-do)\r\n- Adding your EEG/MEG/MRI (pre)processing pipelines, so they are preinstalled in AEDAPT (a great way to reach a wider user base)\r\n- Pipelines can be written in any programming language, as each AEDAPT pipeline is packaged within a container\r\n- Adding publicly available EEG/MEG/MRI (pre)processing pipelines, so they can be easily accessible within AEDAPT\r\n- There will be an icon in the AEDAPT menu to run them. You can write a script to query the user for the required parameters and run the pipeline automatically.\r\n\r\n### Good first issues\r\n\r\n1. Issue one:\r\nDownload Neurodesk from https://neurodesk.github.io/ and test it for your EEG/MEG work. This is the technological platform of AEDAPT.\r\nReport any problems in: https://github.com/NeuroDesk/neurodesk.github.io/discussions\r\n\r\n2. Issue two:\r\nIf you have EEG data in the Neuroscan\u2019s (.cnt) format, download SOVABIDS from https://sovabids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README.html#installation and test it. \r\nAlternatively, you can use publicly available EEG .cnt raw data (see below under \u201cdata to use\u201d)\r\nReport any problems in: https://github.com/yjmantilla/sovabids/issues\r\n\r\n3. Issue three:\r\nAdding EEG/MEG workflow examples to our documentation page (workflows that use the tools preinstalled in AEDAPT). There is also the possibility to record video tutorials.\r\nhttps://neurodesk.github.io/tutorials/electrophysiology/\r\nPossible idea: a workflow to convert raw EEG data in the .cnt format to BIDS standard using SOVABIDS, and then preprocess it using EEGLAB (available in AEDAPT).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Communication channels\r\n\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/virtual-neuro-machine-vnm\r\n\r\n### Skills\r\n\r\nFor good first issues:\r\n-\tInterest in EEG/MEG/multimodal analyses (EEGlab, MNE, BrainStorm, FieldTrip \u2026.)\r\n-\tInterest/knowledge of the BIDS standard\r\n-\tFamiliarity with EEG raw data formats\r\n-\tWriting documentation using Markdown (https://www.markdownguide.org/)\r\n\r\nFor main goals:\r\n-\tFamiliarity with how Google search works -- we want people to find out about AEDAPT through Google searches\r\n-\tPython\r\n-\tKnowhow on installing MATLAB on Linux and setting up licenses\r\n-\tKnowhow on installing applications on Linux\r\n-\tBuilding and testing docker containers\r\n-\tExpertise in compiling MATLAB code\r\n-\tGithub actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Onboarding documentation\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What will participants learn?\r\n\r\nBIDS (https://bids.neuroimaging.io/)\r\nDocker containers\r\nGithub workflows\r\nCompiling MATLAB code\r\nJSON-RPC API\r\n\r\n\r\n### Data to use\r\n\r\nPublicly available Neuroscan\u2019s raw EEG data in .cnt format\r\n\r\nDriving simulator experiment\r\nPaper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0027-4\r\nData: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/The_original_EEG_data_for_driver_fatigue_detection/5202739\r\n\r\nMotor imagery experiment\r\nPaper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0535-2\r\nData: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RBN3XG\r\n\r\n\r\n### Number of collaborators\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n### Credit to collaborators\r\n\r\nProject contributors will be listed on the website, on Github, and potentially be part of publications originating from the project.\r\n\r\n### Image\r\n\r\n\r\n![AEDAPT_BrainHack 2021_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45424980/143202895-1bcb86f7-9769-406f-bd3d-dc900d0a3432.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Type\r\n\r\ncoding_methods, documentation, pipeline_development, tutorial_recording\r\n\r\n### Development status\r\n\r\n2_releases_existing\r\n\r\n### Topic\r\n\r\nconnectome, data_visualisation, diffusion, EEG_EventRelatedResponseModelling, EEG_source_modelling, hypothesis_testing, ICA, neural_decoding, neural_encoding, neural_networks, PCA, physiology, reproducible_scientific_methods, statistical_modelling, systems_neuroscience\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n\r\nBIDS, Brainstorm, Datalad, FieldTrip, Freesurfer, Jupyter, MNE, Nipype, SPM\r\n\r\n### Programming language\r\n\r\ncontainerization, documentation, Matlab, Python, shell_scripting, unix_command_line, html_css\r\n\r\n### Modalities\r\n\r\nbehavioral, ECG, ECOG, EEG, eye_tracking, MEG, MRI, TDCS, TMS\r\n\r\n### Git skills\r\n\r\n2_branches_PRs\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nMore information about AEDAPT can be found on our website: aedapt.net\r\n\r\n### Things to do after the project is submitted.\r\n\r\n- [X] Add a comment saying: `Hi @Brainhack-Global/project-monitors: my project is ready!`\r\n- [X] Twitter-sized summary of your project pitch.",
