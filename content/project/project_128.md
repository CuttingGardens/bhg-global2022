  "content": "hi @ohbm/project-monitors: My project is ready!\r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\n## Project info\r\nThe **shimming-toolbox** is open-source Matlab software enabling a variety of MRI shimming (magnetic field homogenization) techniques for use with custom \"multi-coil\" arrays or standard manufacturer-supplied hardware.\r\nThis project was initiated by the NeuroPoly Lab (Polytechnique Montr\u00e9al) in collaboration with the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging (MGH / Harvard Medical School).\r\n\r\n**Title**:\r\nshimming-toolbox: Ecosystem for real-time shimming with MRI\r\n\r\n**Project lead**:\r\n- Julien Cohen-Adad @jcohenadad,\r\n- Ryan Topfer @rtopfer \r\n- Alexandre D'Astous @po09i \r\n- Gaspard Cereza @gaspardcereza \r\n- Eva Alonso-Ortiz @evaalonsoortiz\r\n- Jason Stockmann @jaystock\r\n\r\n**[Timezone](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#timezone)**:\r\nUTC-5\r\n\r\n**Hub**:\r\nThe Americas\r\n\r\n**Description**:\r\nA prerequisite to correcting/shimming the MR \"b0\" field is of course to measure it (commonly done using a dual-echo gradient-echo sequence). A recent paper by [Fatnassi and Zaidi](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6560/aae570) suggests that multi-echo (n>2) sequences may yield better accuracy and higher SNR. This *brainhack* project aims to implement multi-echo field mapping algorithms and assess their efficiency.\r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\n[shimming-toolbox repository](https://github.com/shimming-toolbox/shimming-toolbox)\r\n[shimming-toolbox website](http://www.shimming-toolbox.org/)\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**:\r\n[shimming-toolbox channel](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/shimming-toolbox)\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\nImplement B0 field mapping algorithms for more than 2 echoes\r\n- Selective weighted field-mapping ([SWFM](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6560/aae570 ))\r\n- Linear least square fit (LLSf) \r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n- [Create numerical model data for multi-echo field maps](https://github.com/shimming-toolbox/shimming-toolbox/issues/102)\r\n- [Implement a complex division (CD) algorithm using 2 echoes](https://github.com/shimming-toolbox/shimming-toolbox/issues/112)\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n- Matlab coding\r\n- MR physics (field mapping, phase unwrapping)\r\n \r\n**Chat channel**:\r\n[shimming-toolbox Mattermost channel](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/shimming-toolbox)\r\n\r\n**Video Channel:** \r\n\r\nPlease have a look at the [Mattermost channel](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/shimming-toolbox) (pinned posts) for the URL of the video channel, or alternatively, please contact to @jcohenadad on Github.\r\n\r\n<!-- **Video channel**:\r\n[shimming-toolbox Jitsi channel](https://meet.jit.si/shimming-toolbox-hackathon) -->\r\n\r\n## Additional project info\r\n\r\n**Acknowledgments**\r\nMembers contributing will be listed [here](https://github.com/shimming-toolbox/shimming-toolbox/graphs/contributors) \r\n\r\n**Links**\r\nLink to [Fatnassi and Zaidi](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6560/aae570 )\r\n\r\n**Twitter project pitch**\r\nNeuropoly\u2019s shimming-toolbox team participates in OHBM Brainhack Hackathon.
