Please also update the title of the issue to be the title of your project-->\r\n\r\n**Project lead**: [Sina Mansour L.](https://github.com/sina-mansour) and [Ye Tian](https://github.com/yetianmed) (@sina-mansour and @yetianmed)\r\n\r\n**Timezone**: Melbourne UTC+10\r\n\r\n**Hub**: Asia and Pacific\r\n\r\n**Description**: \r\n\r\nEmerging evidence suggests the outstanding utility of multimodal neuroimaging data in predicting individual variation in age and cognition. However, it is unclear whether the predictive utility of such measures is a global effect or is consistently attributed to certain localized patterns of brain structure and connectivity.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to evaluate and develop an analysis framework for optimal performance of age and behavior (e.g. fluid intelligence) prediction using measures of brain structure and connectivity. The goal is to achieve both overall high prediction accuracy in cross-validated samples and high consistency in the estimated predictors (e.g. regions/connections) if possible. A secondary aim of the project is to investigate the potential markers of sub-clinical cognitive decline through simultaneous prediction of age and cognition in a healthy adult cohort.\r\n\r\n<!--Describe the main idea and context of your project in a few sentences.-->\r\n\r\n**Link to project**: [2020_ohbm_brainhack_machine_learning_project](https://gitlab.com/sina_mansour/2020_ohbm_brainhack_machine_learning_project)\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**: `sina_mansour_l` and `yetian`\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**: Collecting implementations of machine learning models to predict age and cognition. This will be followed by a future evaluation of prediction accuracy and feature selection consistency in prediction models of age and IQ using multimodal neuroimaging dataset.\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\nStep 1: [Clone the repository](https://gitlab.com/sina_mansour/2020_ohbm_brainhack_machine_learning_project/-/issues/1)\r\nStep 2: [Join our chat channel](https://gitlab.com/sina_mansour/2020_ohbm_brainhack_machine_learning_project/-/issues/2)\r\nStep 3: [Register your team](https://gitlab.com/sina_mansour/2020_ohbm_brainhack_machine_learning_project/-/issues/new?issuable_template=register_team)\r\nStep 4: Start coding :)\r\n\r\n**Skills**: General knowledge about neuroimaging modalities, neuropsychology, and familiarity with a programming language (Python, Matlab, or any language you prefer :wink: )\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**: [mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/brainhack-ml](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/brainhack-ml)\r\n\r\n**Video channel**:\r\nPlease have a look at the mattermost channel to know the video channel.\r\n\r\n**Participant capacity**: We look forward to maximum participation from the neuroimaging community. There is no limit to the number of participants, we will try our best to provide static information, and build an FAQ system to ensure we can provide feedback to participants.\r\n\r\n**Contributions**: All contributors (participants and teams) will be listed in [our public repository](https://gitlab.com/sina_mansour/2020_ohbm_brainhack_machine_learning_project/-/tree/master). After post hoc evaluations of the models, participants submitting well-performing models will be contacted for future collaboration on potential publications.\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username).
