Possibly more than 1 hub.-->\r\n\r\n**Description**: Cross decomposition algorithms look for the relations between two (or more) blocks of variables. These methods are particularly used in neuroimaging to analyze associations between physiological/behavioral variables and brain structure/function.\r\nBetween unsupervised and supervised modeling, this family of algorithms has many members (e.g. CCA, PLS regression, PLS canonical, PLS-PM, etc.) and many approaches are possible to validate the trained model (e.g. cross validation, bootstrapping, permutation test, etc.).\r\nIn this project, I propose to write several Python tutorials to help the application and interpretation of these models in practice.\r\n<!--Describe the main idea and context of your project in a few sentences.-->\r\n\r\n**Link to project**: [https://github.com/LeonieBorne/plstuto](https://github.com/LeonieBorne/plstuto)\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**: leonie.borne\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\nCreation of a set of tutorials to facilitate the use of cross decomposition methods for neuroimaging studies in python. \r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n[Wang, Hao-Ting, et al. \"Finding the needle in a high-dimensional haystack: Canonical correlation analysis for neuroscientists.\" NeuroImage (2020): 116745.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116745)\r\nFrom the above article, several tutorials can be considered: the first one on data preprocessing, the second one on data reduction and the third one on model selection.\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\nPython (beginner), Jupyter notebook, Github (Git - 1)\r\nAny knowledge/interest in cross decomposition methods is very welcome!\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**: <a href=\"https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/pls-tuto\">\r\n  <img src=\"http://www.mattermost.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/logoHorizontal.png\" width=100px>\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Video channel**:\r\nPlease have a look at the mattermost channel to know the video channel.\r\n\r\n**Kanban board**:\r\nCheck [here](https://github.com/LeonieBorne/plstuto/projects/1).\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Include your Mattermost handle]. If you do not have an account, please [sign up here](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/signup_email).\r\n-   [x] Goals for the OHBM Brainhack: describe what you want to achieve during this brainhack. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#goals).\r\n-   [x] Flesh out at least 2 \"good first issues\": those are tasks that do not require any prior knowledge about your project, could be defined as issues in a GitHub repository, or in a shared document, cf [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#onboarding-2-good-first-issues).\r\n-   [x] Skills: list skills that would be particularly suitable for your project. We ask you to include at least one non-coding skill, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#onboarding-skills).\r\n-   [x] Chat channel: A link to a chat channel that will be used during the OHBM Brainhack. This can be an existing channel or a new one. We recommend using the [Brainhack space on mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/), cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#chat).\r\n-   [x] Video channel: Please create a video channel that will be used during the OHBM Brainhack and share it in your chat channel above. This can be an existing channel or a new one. For instance a [jitsi meet](https://meet.jit.si/) room, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#video-calls).\r\n\r\nYou can also include information about (all optional):\r\n-   [ ] Number of participants, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#participant-capacity)\r\n-   [ ] Twitter-size summary of your project pitch, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#twitter-size-summary-of-your-project-pitch)\r\n-   [x] Provide an image of your project for the OHBM brainhack website\r\n-   [x] Set up a kanban board on your repository to better divide the work and keep track of things, cf [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#set-up-a-kanban-board)\r\n-   [ ] Project snippet for the OHBM Brainhack website, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#project-snippet-for-the-ohbm-brainhack-website)\r\n\r\nWe would like to think about how you will credit and onboard new members to your project. We recommend reading references from [this section](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#credit-and-onboarding). If you'd like to share your thoughts with future project participants, you can include information about (recommended):\r\n-   [ ] Specify how will you acknowledge contributions (e.g. listing members on a contributing page).\r\n-   [ ] Provide links to onboarding documents if you have some.\r\n"
