Ellis @CameronTEllis,  Qihong Lu @qihongl, Mihai Capota @mihaic, and Sam Nastase @snastase\r\n\r\n**[Timezone](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#timezone)**: \r\nUTC -4\r\n\r\n**Hub**: \r\nThe Americas. \r\nParticipants from all hubs are welcome to participate.\r\n\r\n**Description**: \r\nThis project will help participants learn fMRI analyses and enhance [BrainIAK Tutorials](https://brainiak.org/tutorials/) (Kumar et al., 2020). Participants can practice a tutorial covering any topic of interest, from basics to advanced techniques. They can also contribute to the tutorials, by making edits, fixing bugs, or enhancing them by applying the techniques to their own datasets. We have an issue list for the tutorials that participants can pick an issue and work on. Some of the advanced techniques included are: Inter-Subject Correlations (ISC) (Hasson et al., 2004; Simony et al., 2016), Shared Response Modeling (SRM) (Chen et al., 2015), and Event Segmentation methods (Baldassano et al., 2017).\r\n\r\n[BrainIAK Project Pitch](https://youtu.be/4nMjmX_t_Dg)\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**:\r\n- Install a working version of brainiak and a ready to use dataset. Google Colab option is also available. [BrainIAK Tutorials](https://brainiak.org/tutorials/)\r\n- Learn and Execute tutorials from basics: Decoding and RSA, to advanced techniques including ISC, SRM, and Event Segmentation.\r\n- Help fix bugs/make enhancements.\r\n- Contributions will be acknowledged within each tutorial as well as on GitHub.\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n- Test tutorials on NeuroLibre.\r\n- Text enhancements to the tutorials.\r\n- Tutorial bug fixes.\r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\n[BrainIAK Tutorials GitHub Repo](https://github.com/brainiak/brainiak-tutorials)\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\nKnowledge of Pyhton\r\nBasics of fMRI processing\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/brainiak\r\n\r\n**Twitter:**\r\n[BrainIAK Project](https://twitter.com/manojneuro/status/1271445130793320448?s=20)\r\n\r\n**Video channel**:\r\nPlease have a look at the [Mattermost channel](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/brainiak) (pinned posts) for the URL of the video channel, or alternatively, please contact to @manojneuro on Github.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- **Video channel**:\r\nhttps://meet.jit.si/BrainIAKPackage -->\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Goals for the OHBM Brainhack: describe what you want to achieve during this brainhack. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#goals).\r\n-   [x] Flesh out at least 2 \"good first issues\": those are tasks that do not require any prior knowledge about your project, could be defined as issues in a GitHub repository, or in a shared document, cf [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#onboarding-2-good-first-issues).\r\n-   [x] Skills: list skills that would be particularly suitable for your project. We ask you to include at least one non-coding skill, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#onboarding-skills).\r\n-   [x] Chat channel: A link to a chat channel that will be used during the OHBM Brainhack. This can be an existing channel or a new one. We recommend using the [Brainhack space on mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/), cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#chat).\r\n-   [x] Video channel: A link to a video channel that will be used during the OHBM Brainhack. This can be an existing channel or a new one. For instance a [jitsi meet](https://meet.jit.si/) room, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#video-calls).\r\n\r\nOptionally, you can also include information about:\r\n-   [x] Number of participants, cf. [No limit. Anyone interested to learn can use the tutorials. There are multiple updates and fixes that need to happen, so multiple people can make contributions.](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#participant-capacity)\r\n-   [x] Twitter-size summary of your project pitch, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#twitter-size-summary-of-your-project-pitch)\r\n-   [x] Provide an image of your project for the OHBM brainhack website\r\n-   [x] Project snippet for the OHBM Brainhack website, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#project-snippet-for-the-ohbm-brainhack-website)\r\n\r\nWe would like to think about how you will credit and onboard new members to your project. We recommend reading references from [this section](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#credit-and-onboarding). If you'd like to share your thoughts with future project participants, you can include information about:\r\n-   [x] Specify how will you acknowledge contributions (e.g. listing members on a contributing page).\r\n-   [x] Provide links to onboarding documents if you have some.\r\nhttps://brainiak.org/tutorials/"
