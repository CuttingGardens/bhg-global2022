  "content": "----------------------------\r\n## Project info\r\nRecent work in neuroscience and other fields has identified a bias in citation practices such that papers from women and other minorities are under-cited relative to the number of such papers in the field. For this project, we seek to further the development of two tools to help researchers combat these trends in their own citation practices. The first tool is an interactive jupyter notebook that provides probabilistic gender break down of first and last authors from a bibliography in a bibtex file. The second is a Google Chrome extension that displays the probabilistic gender of first and last authors of papers on the common search engines Google Scholar and PubMed\r\n\r\n**Title**:\r\nTools for Combating Citation Bias\r\n\r\n**Project lead**:\r\n@jastiso, @dalejn\r\n\r\n**[Timezone]**\r\nUTC -4\r\n\r\n**Hub**:\r\nThe Americas\r\n\r\n**Description**:\r\nIn neuroscience, authors tend to cite women at a rate lower than you would expect given their prevalence in the field. We wanted to give researchers tools to quantify and combat these biased citation practices. We have developed (1) a binder that will quantify the gender breakdown of first and last authors in a bibtex file, and (2) a google chrome extension that will display the inferred gender of first and last authors in Google Scholar and PubMed searches. If you're interested in the project but don't have the listed skills there are still ways you can help! We are also looking for people to use the tools and help us find bugs and inefficiencies. We would also like to note that this approach assumes a false gender binary, and that future iterations of this project would use pronouns or self reported identity. \r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\nhttps://github.com/dalejn/cleanBib\r\nhttps://github.com/jastiso/citation_bias_ext\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**:\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\nWe seek to further the development of two tools :\r\n- The first tool is an interactive jupyter notebook that provides probabilistic gender break down of first and last authors from a bibliography in a bibtex file. \r\n- The second is a Google Chrome extension that displays the probabilistic gender of first and last authors of papers on the common search engines Google Scholar and PubMed.\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n- build SQL database that can be accessed from a javascript file\r\n- using javascript, iterate through DOIs of papers displayed on a PubMed search\r\n- build a visualization of the gender breakdown of authors from a bibtex file into a binder\r\n- track, and generate list of all publications who have used the binder tool (Zenodo citation) using Crossref, or similar API\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n- knowledge of gender and race theory\r\n- python, javascript, SQL, html\r\n- experience with flask, ajax, heroku, or docker\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:\r\n[hbmhack-citation-bias](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/citation-bias\r\n)\r\n\r\n**Video channel**:\r\n\r\nPlease have a look at the [Mattermost channel](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/citation-bias\r\n) (pinned posts) for the URL of the video channel, or alternatively, please contact @jastiso and @dalejn on Github. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Include your Mattermost handle. If you do not have an account, please [sign up here](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/signup_email).\r\n@jeni.stiso\r\n@dalezhou\r\n-   [x] Goals for the OHBM Brainhack: describe what you want to achieve during this brainhack. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#goals).\r\n-   [x] Flesh out at least 2 \"good first issues\": those are tasks that do not require any prior knowledge about your project, could be defined as issues in a GitHub repository, or in a shared document, cf [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#onboarding-2-good-first-issues).\r\n-   [x] Skills: list skills that would be particularly suitable for your project. We ask you to include at least one non-coding skill, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#onboarding-skills).\r\n-   [x] Chat channel: A link to a chat channel that will be used during the OHBM Brainhack. This can be an existing channel or a new one. We recommend using the [Brainhack space on mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/), cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#chat).\r\n-   [x] Video channel: Please create a video channel that will be used during the OHBM Brainhack and share it in your chat channel above. This can be an existing channel or a new one. For instance a [jitsi meet](https://meet.jit.si/) room.\r\nThere's a jitsi link pinned in the mattermost channel\r\n\r\nYou can also include information about (all optional):\r\n-   [ ] Number of participants, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#participant-capacity)\r\n-   [ ] Twitter-size summary of your project pitch, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#twitter-size-summary-of-your-project-pitch)\r\n-   [x] Provide an image of your project for the OHBM brainhack website\r\n-   [ ] Set up a kanban board on your repository to better divide the work and keep track of things, cf [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#set-up-a-kanban-board)\r\n-   [x] Project snippet for the OHBM Brainhack website, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#project-snippet-for-the-ohbm-brainhack-website)\r\n\r\nWe would like to think about how you will credit and onboard new members to your project. We recommend reading references from [this section](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#credit-and-onboarding). If you'd like to share your thoughts with future project participants, you can include information about (recommended):\r\n-   [x] Specify how will you acknowledge contributions (e.g. listing members on a contributing page).\r\nContributors will be listed alphabetically on the github page for each project. For the Binder/notebook project, contributors will be added to the Zenodo link with the next major release\r\n-   [ ] Provide links to onboarding documents if you have some.\r\n"
