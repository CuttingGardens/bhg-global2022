The schema allows internationalization (multiple languages), is implementation agnostic, and tracks variations in assessments (e.g., PHQ-9, PHQ-8).\r\nThis open and accessible schema library with appropriate conversion (e.g., to RedCap) and data collection tools (e.g., MindLogger, LORIS, RedCap) enables more consistent acquisition across projects, with results being harmonized by design.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Link to project**: https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema\r\nhttps://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-ui\r\nhttps://github.com/sensein/voice-backend\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**: @sanuann\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n- reproschema-starter-kit (non-coding)\r\n- adding new/verifying activities (non-coding)\r\n- adding new languages (non-coding)\r\n- validation library (requires coding)\r\n- create dashboard for collected results (requires coding)\r\n- improve schema-ui widgets (requires coding)\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\nhttps://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema/issues/371\r\nhttps://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema/issues/377\r\nhttps://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-ui/issues/141\r\nhttps://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-ui/issues/129\r\nhttps://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-ui/issues/125\r\nand more.\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n- documentation, git\r\n- JSON-LD, SHACL\r\n- vuejs, javascript, python\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-reproschema\r\n\r\n**Video channel**:\r\nPlease have a look at the [Mattermost channel](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbmhack-reproschema) (pinned posts) for the URL of the video channel, or alternatively, please contact to @sanuann on Mattermost.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n**Video channel**:\r\n\r\nWe are trying to be super careful about \"zoom bombing\" possibility.\r\nSo we want to avoid having links to video chats in \"public space\".\r\nWe suggest that you create a Jitsi or Zoom room and mention it in your text channel as \"pinned\" message or in the channel header.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Image for the OHBM brainhack website**\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username).
