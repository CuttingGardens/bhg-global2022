Here we provide a Python library based on the [MNE Python](https://mne.tools/) ecosystem that allows (social) neuroscientists to carry-out and to interpret inter-brain connectivity analyses. More info on our dedicated [preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/x5apu).\r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\nhttps://github.com/GHFC/HyPyP\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**:\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hypyp\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n- Validate the getting started tutorial and documentation.\r\n- Test the reliability of all the connectivity measure and statistical tests.\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n- Try to install the library and report any difficulty\r\n- Try to run the tutorial and report any difficulty\r\n- Simulate fake data and visualize them\r\n- Test the connectivity measures\r\n- Test the statistical analyses tools\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\nPython, MEG/EEG, Signal processing\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hypyp\r\n\r\n**Video channel**:\r\nPlease have a look at the mattermost channel to know the video channel.\r\n\r\n**Image for the OHBM brainhack website**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/208779/84565814-47bf1600-ad6c-11ea-82e5-dab1a0c0fb05.png)\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [X] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username). If you do not have an account, please [sign up here](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/signup_email).\r\n-   [X] Goals for the OHBM Brainhack: describe what you want to achieve during this brainhack. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#goals).\r\n-   [x] Flesh out at least 2 \"good first issues\": those are tasks that do not require any prior knowledge about your project, could be defined as issues in a GitHub repository, or in a shared document, cf [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#onboarding-2-good-first-issues).\r\n-   [x] Skills: list skills that would be particularly suitable for your project. We ask you to include at least one non-coding skill, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#onboarding-skills).\r\n-   [X] Chat channel: A link to a chat channel that will be used during the OHBM Brainhack. This can be an existing channel or a new one. We recommend using the [Brainhack space on mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/), cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#chat).\r\n-   [X] Video channel: Please create a video channel that will be used during the OHBM Brainhack and share it in your chat channel above. This can be an existing channel or a new one. For instance a [jitsi meet](https://meet.jit.si/) room, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#video-calls).\r\n-   [X] Provide an image of your project for the OHBM brainhack website\r\n\r\nYou can also include information about (all optional):\r\n-   [ ] Number of participants, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#participant-capacity)\r\n-   [ ] Twitter-size summary of your project pitch, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#twitter-size-summary-of-your-project-pitch)\r\n-   [ ] Set up a kanban board on your repository to better divide the work and keep track of things, cf [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#set-up-a-kanban-board)\r\n-   [ ] Project snippet for the OHBM Brainhack website, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#project-snippet-for-the-ohbm-brainhack-website)\r\n\r\nWe would like to think about how you will credit and onboard new members to your project. We recommend reading references from [this section](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#credit-and-onboarding). If you'd like to share your thoughts with future project participants, you can include information about (recommended):\r\n-   [ ] Specify how will you acknowledge contributions (e.g. listing members on a contributing page).\r\n-   [ ] Provide links to onboarding documents if you have some.\r\n"
