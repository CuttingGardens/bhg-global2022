A permanent place for hacking together.**\r\n\r\n**Team:**\r\nKatja, Roberto, Anibal, Remi, Isil, Austin, Sofie\r\nproject lead: katja\r\n\r\n**Timezone:**\r\nUTC+2\r\n(Paris, France)\r\n\r\n**Hub:**\r\nEurope, Middle East and Africa\r\n\r\n**Description:**\r\n\r\nIn a team effort across continents, we recently created the [BrainWeb](https://brain-web.github.io), a permanent virtual space for online collaborations on projects related to neuroscience.\r\nIt has built so quickly a large community of >200 members, that this is the current community graph:\r\nhttps://brain-web.github.io/community/\r\n![BrainWeb_communityGraph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6297454/84762835-9c140100-afcb-11ea-9667-3ee8b87633a9.png)\r\n\r\nWe also have a a projects page  \r\n![BrainWeb_projects](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brain-web/gazette/master/img/BrainWebGazette001.jpg)\r\n\r\nAnd we now also host our own BrainWeb-jitsi for community calls, where we can send love \u2764\ufe0f  and brains \ud83e\udde0 , rockets \ud83d\ude80 and more love \ud83d\udc95 .\r\n<img width=\"671\" alt=\"BrainWeb_jitsi\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6297454/84790315-8285b000-aff1-11ea-95bb-f2021e8d469f.png\">\r\n\r\nNow how can we improve the BrainWeb? During this Hackathon, we would like to \r\n\r\n**1** add the possibility to filter the community graph by skills, so that we can easily find people to collaborate with \u2013 either based on shared interests or to add skills to our team that we are lacking\r\n\r\n**2** add all BrainWeb videoconference rooms in a sidebar on the page, and indicators of occupancy for all of them, like a green dot if there's someone in\r\n\r\n**3** add a posters room. The problem: How to improve the online poster room experience? How can we approach the stuff we miss from real poster rooms? Which are the new things we can have in a virtual, permanent, poster room? @katja showed a possibility that would be fun to explore, hacking MicroDraw.\r\n\r\n**4** by embedding jitsi in our videoconference tab, we have access to a shared data channel. We are currently using it to send emojis, but this is just a tiny starting point. We could use the data channel to synchronise quite sophisticated shared experiences! For example, a presenter could share a 3D brain (cf @dr.alecrimi)\r\n\r\nIf you'd love to work with us on the BrainWeb, join us on [Mattermost ~brainweb](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/brainweb), and find our [GitHub repo here](https://github.com/brain-web/brain-web.github.io).\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hacking with all of you! \ud83c\udf1e  \u2764\ufe0f \r\n\r\n"
