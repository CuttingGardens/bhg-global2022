This includes any records of eye position metrics such as fixation, eye movements (saccades, microsaccades, pursuit), blinks, and pupillometry.\r\n\r\nEyeTrackPrep is meant in the future to be used by all researchers using eye-tracking data. It aims at simplifying and standardizing this domain to improve research reproducibility as well as the share of collected data.\r\n\r\nEye-tracking community lack such a tool even if a need for it is clear. Although this project might take time until a functional software is produced, it will modify for long term the way cognitive neuroscientists work and generate open science of high quality data akin what happened with the development of BIDS-apps from the neuroimaging community.\n\n### Link to project repository/sources\n\nhttps://github.com/mszinte/eyetrackprep.git\n\n### Goals for Brainhack Global\n\nTogether with colleagues, we already thought of a few directions for EyeTrackPrep. The Brainhack will consist of discussions about the tool, its goals, what it should and what it should not include. Moreover, if we have more time we could code the modeling of eye movement metrics (e.g. saccade detection from eye-traking position time series) as well as some of the visualization for data quality check.\n\n### Good first issues\n\nAgree on what such app should do (e.g. saccade, smooth pursuit analysis...)\n\n### Communication channels\n\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/eyetrackprep\n\n### Skills\n\nNon-coding skills: knowledge of eyetracking data or interest in it\r\nCoding skills: Python basics\n\n### Onboarding documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### What will participants learn?\n\nEyetracking analysis: saccade and smooth pursuit analysis\r\nBIDS usage: using of tools to share and re-use your eyetracking datasets.\r\n\n\n### Data to use\n\n_No response_\n\n### Number of collaborators\n\nmore\n\n### Credit to collaborators\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se Collins\r\nGuillaume Masson\r\nAnna Montagnini\r\nMartin Rolfs\r\nMartin Szinte\r\nTomas Knapen\r\n\n\n### Image\n\n![EyePrep](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22450126/143491197-1430bb4b-5eae-4eb2-90eb-60763eef8e3a.png)\r\n\n\n### Type\n\ndata_management, method_development\n\n### Development status\n\n0_concept_no_content\n\n### Topic\n\ndata_visualisation, other\n\n### Tools\n\nBIDS, Jupyter, other\n\n### Programming language\n\nPython\n\n### Modalities\n\neye_tracking\n\n### Git skills\n\n0_no_git_skills, 1_commit_push, 2_branches_PRs\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Things to do after the project is submitted.\n\n- [ ] Add a comment saying: `Hi @Brainhack-Global/project-monitors: my project is ready!`\n- [ ] Twitter-sized summary of your project pitch.",
