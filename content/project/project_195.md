  "project_description": "\r\n\r\nThe challenge of automatically extracting a brain mask from neuroimaging data has attracted a lot of interest in the context of high-resolution anatomical-contrast data. Processing pipelines involving Diffusion MRI data commonly also require derivation of a brain mask. This has however not attracted the same development interest, despite regular feedback that this is regularly a point of failure for group studies.\r\n\r\nThis project will involve development of a generalised interface for derivation of DWI brain masks in the [*MRtrix3* software](https://www.mrtrix.org/). The [current \"`dwi2mask`\" binary command](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/commands/dwi2mask.html#dwi2mask) (written in C++) will be replaced with an interface implemented in Python, through which the user will have the ability to select from a range of different algorithms available for performing these tasks. Alternative approaches for DWI brain masking implemented in other software packages will be wrapped in order to provide access to all of these alternatives within a standardised interface, integrating compatibility with all of the image formats supported by *MRtrix3*.\r\n\r\nIf successful, changes will be included in a future update to the *MRtrix3* software. [Contributors](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) will be included in the built-in `git` [contribution statistics](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/graphs/contributors).

If there is [adequate test data](https://community.mrtrix.org/t/seeking-challenging-dwi-masking-data/3783) and differential performance between methods, a manuscript may be written reporting on the results of this analysis, on which all team members would be invited to contribute.\r\n\r\n**Link to project**: MRtrix3/mrtrix3#2075\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**: @lestropie\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack** / **Good first issues**:\r\n\r\nThe range of possible milestones are presented in MRtrix3/mrtrix3#2075. The minimum requirements for the Hackathon would be: Re-implementation of existing *MRtrix3* `dwi2mask` C++ code in Python; wrapper algorithm for executing FSL's `bet` tool on the mean *b*=0 image; have both of these approaches available from a common interface.\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n\r\nSome experience with Python, *MRtrix3* and/or `git` would be advantageous; the pace of the project will however be tailored to the skillset of team members.
