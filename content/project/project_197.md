In this project we will focus on implementing a database to track information on pipelines, datasets and available execution records. Using this database, we will extract useful information for this recommendation system.\r\n\r\nLink to project: https://github.com/mandana-mazaheri/CONP-recommender\r\n\r\nMattermost handle: \r\n@Mandana_mazaheri , @aida , @samsoltan\r\n\r\nGoals for the OHBM Brainhack: \r\nCreate execution examples for CONP pipelines on CONP datasets.\r\nRun and debug these examples\r\nPublish the resulting execution records to Zenodo\r\n\r\nGood first issues:\r\n\r\n1. Download a CONP dataset.\r\n2. Run a Boutiques pipeline on a CONP dataset.\r\n\r\nSkills:\r\n\r\n* Experience or interest in data analysis\r\n* Familiarity with [DataLad](http://www.datalad.org) \r\n* Familiarity with [Boutiques](http://boutiques.github.io)\r\n* Interest in execution provenance\r\n* Familiarity with Python\r\n* Familiarity with databases\r\n\r\n**Chat channel:**\r\n\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbm-conp-recommender\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Video channel:** \r\nPlease have a look at the [Mattermost channel](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbm-conp-recommender) (pinned posts) for the URL of the video channel, or alternatively, please contact to @Mandana_mazaheri , @aida , @samsoltan on Mattermost.\r\n\r\n\r\nImage for the OHBM brainhack website\r\n\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nMandana Mazaheri, [13.06.20 20:00]\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Include your [Mattermost handle](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/) (i.e. your username). If you do not have an account, please [sign up here](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/signup_email).\r\n-   [x] Goals for the OHBM Brainhack: describe what you want to achieve during this brainhack. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#goals).\r\n-   [x] Flesh out at least 2 \"good first issues\": those are tasks that do not require any prior knowledge about your project, could be defined as issues in a GitHub repository, or in a shared document, cf [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#onboarding-2-good-first-issues).\r\n-   [x] Skills: list skills that would be particularly suitable for your project. We ask you to include at least one non-coding skill, cf.

This can be an existing channel or a new one. We recommend using the [Brainhack space on mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/), cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#chat).\r\n-   [ ] Video channel: Please create a video channel that will be used during the OHBM Brainhack and share it in your chat channel above. This can be an existing channel or a new one. For instance a [jitsi meet](https://meet.jit.si/) room, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#video-calls).\r\n-   [ ] Provide an image of your project for the OHBM brainhack website\r\n\r\nYou can also include information about (all optional):\r\n-   [ ] Number of participants, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#participant-capacity)\r\n-   [ ] Twitter-size summary of your project pitch, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#twitter-size-summary-of-your-project-pitch)\r\n-   [ ] Set up a kanban board on your repository to better divide the work and keep track of things, cf [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#set-up-a-kanban-board)\r\n-   [x] Project snippet for the OHBM Brainhack website, cf.
