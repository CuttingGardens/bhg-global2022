  "project_description": "\r\nAre you asking to yourself \"how can the year 2020 get more **interesting**?\". The answer is simple: by using a particle simulator to explode some brains at the comfort of your home, in a completely safe *virtual* environment. \r\n\r\nAfter concluding my [previous hackaton project](https://github.com/OpenMRBenelux/openmrb2020-hackathon/issues/7) with \"more research is needed\", here I am planning to continue exploding more brains in many ways.

In this event, I am planning to work on adding multi-phase explosions.\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n1. Install [Slowest particle simulator on earth](https://github.com/ofgulban/slowest-particle-simulator-on-earth).\r\n2. Use it to explode a brain image that you want to explode. Some options might be:\r\n    - A bad subject who moved too much.\r\n    - Your supervisor's brain.\r\n    - Maybe even your own brain.\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\nPython, enjoying visual effects, and optionally C, C++, or Cython for understanding the source material mentioned in [here](https://github.com/OpenMRBenelux/openmrb2020-hackathon/issues/7) (please see this link for further details).\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:\r\nMattermost channel `brainexplosions`\r\n\r\n**Video channel**:\r\nTODO: Add when prepared.\r\n\r\n## Project submission\r\n\r\n## Submission checklist\r\n*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under 'Additional project info'*\r\n\r\nPlease include the following above (all required):\r\n-   [x] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project)\r\n-   [x] Include your Mattermost handle].
