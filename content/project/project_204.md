  "project_description": " With diffusion MRI, we can track the axon fibers in the brain white matter. Although a certain level of variability exists, we still believe that there are a substantial amount of fiber bundles/tracts that are common across subjects. Thus, matching the fiber bundles across subjects could help us understand the common architecture of white matter in the human brain. The correspondence realized by the tract matching is beneficial for any tract-based statistics, e.g, FA on tract and functional connectivity on tract. \r\n\r\n<!--Describe the main idea and context of your project in a few sentences.-->\r\n\r\n**Link to project**: https://github.com/Jinglei-Lv/Matching-white-matter-fiber-tracts-across-subjects.git\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**: jinglei.lv\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n1.
