  "project_description": "\r\nWith the advent of container technology, cumbersome virtual machines have been reduced to a single container file that can be easily run on multiple-environments. Containers can be run both interactively (e.g., within a Virtual Machine on the cloud) and in batch processing (e.g., on HPC), thus contributing to reproducibility across stages of the analysis. The goal of this project is to generate a \"virtual neuro machine\" container, i.e. a large container that includes most popular neuroimaging tools, and can be used as a stand-alone VM. Although tools to generate neuroimaging software containers are already in place (e.g., neurodocker), continued maintenance of such a large container with complex library dependencies requires in-built testing capabilities, and especially so, of included GUI applications. This project will bring together people working on different environments and using different neuroimaging tools, in order to: 1) build a working container with the newest software versions available in June 2020, 2) develop in-built testing capabilities, to facilitate future container upgrades, 3) develop a standard \"home screen\" for the container, to provide common interface across host environments.\r\n\r\n**Link to project**:\r\nhttps://github.com/NeuroDesk\r\n\r\n**Mattermost handle**:\r\norenciv\r\n\r\n**Goals for the OHBM Brainhack**\r\n1) build a working container with the newest software versions available in June 2020\r\n2) have a routine for testing the container on an OpenStack virtual machine accessed via VNC\r\n\r\n**Good first issues**:\r\n1) choose a tool to test graphical applications running within a container\r\n2) identify built-in testing routines provided by each of the main neuroimaging tools\r\n\r\n**Skills**:\r\n1) neurodocker (https://github.com/ReproNim/neurodocker), or equivalent tools (recommendations would be appreciated)\r\n2) docker\r\n3) singularity\r\n4) expertise in neuroimaging packages included in neurodocker\r\n5) expertise in graphical design (to design a \"home screen\" for the container, as graphical desktops cannot be easily containarised)\r\n6) expertise in GUI development for Linux (any language)\r\n7) continous integration (CI) for containers\r\n\r\n**Chat channel**:\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/virtual-neuro-machine-vnm\r\n\r\n**Video channel**:\r\nPlease have a look at the mattermost channel (pinned posts) for the URL of the video channel, or alternatively, email orenciv@gmail.com\r\n\r\n**Project snippet for the OHBM Brainhack website**:\r\n   title: \"Virtual Neuro Machine (VNM)\"\r\n   image: https://drive.google.com/file/d/18NiPnrzK3ylPKjiXOJyuP8eBTSZ4ic1D/view\r\n   details: \"With the advent of container technology, cumbersome virtual machines have been reduced to a single container file that can be easily run on multiple-environments.
